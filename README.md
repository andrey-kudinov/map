# Books Project

This is a project for my friend who studies at university and needs help with a web development course.

[Demo](https://books-university-project.netlify.app/)

## Description

There are three roles:

- **Guest** can add bookmarks (session storage);

- **User** can add bookmarks. The bookmarks are saved on AirTable. User can update a nickname and an avatar. A New User is added automatically when he logs in with a login that is not on AirTable;

- **Admin** can do the same things that user can do. Also he can add/remove books and users.

## Disadvantages
I wanted to use Firebase. I've worked a lot with Firebase, so after thinking, I have chosen AirTable as something new for me.
AirTable isn’t equal to Firebase. It hasn’t got any auth methods. So my auth is quite simple and isn’t defend from hacks.

## Advantages
My design and animations look pretty interesting.
Also there is a good code base in the project.

## Peculiarity
I have created this project for my friend, who doesn’t know JS as good as I would like to. So I haven’t used any frameworks like React or Vue.
I understand that with frameworks the project's codebase will be smaller. But I think Vanilla JS is better to understand than some kind of framework.

## Feedback
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

## Todo
- add functionality for add/update/remove authors
- add logic to a facet filter on the home page
